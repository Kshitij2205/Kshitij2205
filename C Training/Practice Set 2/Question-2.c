//  But, if they ask in general then the answer will be Double to be more accurate.
//  Double: a data type in C language that stores high-precision floating-point data or 
//  numbers in computer memory. It is called double data type because 
//  it can hold the double size of data compared to the float data type. 
//  A double has 8 bytes, which is equal to 64 bits in size.
