Here are my three favourite malwares, two of them are created by nikitpad. 
He is a hobby programmer and I want to be like him...

And one of them is created by wipet, a cool kid :v

So here are the links of the demonstration of these malwares (im not demonstrating these btw) -


Solaris.exe by Nikitpad - https://youtu.be/H_C7A3ZrbFA
- I really like the graphical payloads and GDI(Graphics Device Interface) effects in it.

Hysterium.exe by Nikitpad - https://youtu.be/RXCg7QI3c_4
- Sound effects 10/10

Quantizer.exe by Wipet - https://youtu.be/uPtblFU62Cc
- The MBR (Master Boot Record) payload got me right there...

I also want to include 'Leurak' in this list.. He also made very unique malwares like Ã¿.exe and MEMZ.exe,
They are also very cool and helped me in get my interest in malwares.

I may make a separate directory of my favourite malwares in future...
